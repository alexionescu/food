# Chicago Deep Dish Pizza Crust
Prep: 6h 10m  
Cook: 45m  
Ready: 6h 55m  

## Ingredients
* 2 1/4 tsp active dry yeast
* 1 1/2 tsp white sugar
* 1 1/8 cups warm water - 110 to 115 F (43 to 45 C)
* 3 cups all-purpose flour
* 1/2 cup corn oil
* 1 1/2 tsp kosher salt

## Directions
1. Dissolve yeast and sugar in warm water in a bowl. Let stand for 5 to 10 minutes until the yeast softens and begins to form a creamy foam.
2. Combine yeast mixture, flour, corn oil, and kosher salt in a large stand mixer with a hook attachment; knead until dough holds together but is still slightly sticky, about 2 minutes.
3. Form dough into a ball and transfer to a buttered bowl, turning to coat. Cover bowl with a towel and allow dough to rise at room temperature until double in size, 6 hours.
4. Punch down dough and let rest for 10 to 15 minutes. Press dough into a 10-inch deep dish pizza pan.
