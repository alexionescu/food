# Amish White Bread
Prep: 1h 50m  
Cook: 40m  
Ready: 2h 30m  

## Ingredients
* 2 cups warm water
* 2/3 cup white sugar
* 1 1/2 tbs active dry yeast
* 1 1/2 tsp salt
* 1/4 cup vegetable oil
* 6 cups bread flour

## Directions
1. In a large bowl, dissolve the sugar in warm water, and then stir in yeast. Allow to proof until yeast resembles a creamy foam.
2. Mix salt and oil into the yeast. Mix in flour one cup at a time. Knead dough on a lightly floured surface until smooth. Place in a well oiled bowl, and turn dough to coat. Cover with a damp cloth. Allow to rise until doubled in bulk, about 1 hour.
3. Punch dough down. Knead for a few minutes, and divide in half. Shape into loaves, and place into two well oiled 9x5 inch loaf pans. Allow to rise for 30 minutes, or until dough has risen 1 inch above pans.
4. Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 30 minutes.
